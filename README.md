# Lending-Club-Project
This project focuses on cleaning, optimizing, and analysing Lending Club data to better understand loan performance and customer behaviour.
ðŸ”§ **Project Overview**
The dataset contains raw Lending Club records, which require preprocessing to make it suitable for analysis.
Our goal is to clean the data, organize it into meaningful DataFrames, and extract insights about loan repayments and defaults.
ðŸš€ **Key Steps**
â€¢	Data Cleaning
  o	Renamed inconsistent column names for better readability
  o	Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity
  o	Dropped rows with missing (NULL) values to improve accuracy
â€¢	Data Optimization
  Segregated the raw dataset into 4 different DataFrames for targeted analysis:
    1.	loans â†’ General loan details
    2.	loans_repayments â†’ Records of repaid loans
    3.	loans_defaulters â†’ Customers who defaulted on loans
    4.	total_customer â†’ Unique customer information
**â€¢	Analysis**
o	Verified and tracked loan defaulters
o	Ensured consistency across different DataFrames for reliable insights
**Outcomes**
  â€¢	A clean and well-structured dataset ready for analysis
  â€¢	Clear identification of loan defaulters and repayment trends
  â€¢	Optimized Data Frames for further modelling or dashboarding
